# Interactive-comic


Project name: “Are You Alone?”

Description: 
Our project is an interactive horror comic. We aimed to create a suspenseful, scary experience that would allow the viewer to choose his own destiny. The story involves a single character, the grudge, that mysteriously appears on one’s TV screen, scares the viewer by both her appearance and speech and jumps out of the TV screen at the end.

Process:
The process could be divided into 6 stages. Firstly, we had a brainstorming session in which we agreed on the topic and theme of the comic. We discussed the plot, sketched the pictures, and decided that we will implement the “choose your own destiny” approach for interactivity. Secondly, Mudi drew the pictures with Adobe Illustrator based on agreed sketches. Afterwards, Rasa combined the drawings with the images of TV screen to create separate scenes. 
I created the initial layout of the webpage. On a black background, the images were put in a way that each one would be revealed while scrolling. I added some scroll animations for each scene, although majority of them had to be changed later in the process after follow-up discussions to create a more consistent look. 
Khalifa then elaborated the code and added more complex elements, such as the buttons and text elements. We finished with a final discussion of the project, and I added 2 more images that got lost in the process as a final touch-up. 

Reflection:
Overall, the website turned out pretty much as I imagined it to be. I do miss a sound and zoom-in effect and with the last picture, which would have made the last image a stronger climax. I believe we also lack a button on the jump-scare that would return to the main page, but in general I really like the simplistic approach to the comic. It aids in building suspense and does not distract the viewer from the story. The choice of building a story on scroll also went well with the theme. Scrolling makes it feel like one is slowly moving through the story and allows the user to choose his own pace. A classic horror script (text) was picked to make the story more familiar for the audience. The script quickly connects with already formed schemas of horror stories and provokes the feeling of fear. I believe that this infliction of emotion made the comic memorable for our audience.
